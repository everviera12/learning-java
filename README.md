# Java Fundamentals for Spring Boot

This repository provides the basic knowledge needed to start learning Spring Boot. Before diving into Spring Boot, it's important to have a solid understanding of core Java concepts. Below are the key topics you should know.

## 1. Java Fundamentals

### Basic Syntax:
- Variables, data types, operators, and control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`).

### Methods and Functions:
- Defining and calling methods.
- Using parameters and return values.

### Classes and Objects:
- How to create classes, instantiate objects, and work with attributes and methods.

### Encapsulation:
- Using `private`, `public`, and managing getters and setters to control access to data.

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Inheritance:
- How to extend classes and reuse code.

### Polymorphism:
- The ability to use derived classes through references to the base class.

### Abstraction and Interfaces:
- Understanding how to use abstract classes and interfaces to define contracts in code.

### Method Overloading and Overriding:
- Knowing the differences and how to implement them.

## 3. Exception Handling
- Using `try-catch-finally` to handle errors.
- Knowledge of custom exceptions and how to throw them (`throw` and `throws`).

## 4. Collections and Streams

### Collections:
- Using collections like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and related classes.

### Streams and Lambda Expressions:
- For data processing (while not required at the start, this is useful in Spring Boot).

## 5. File Handling and I/O
- Reading and writing files using Java I/O classes.
- Using `Scanner`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileWriter`.

## 6. Concurrent Programming

- Basic concepts of threads (`Thread` and `Runnable`), although you don't need to be an expert, it's important to know what concurrency is and how it works.

## 7. Knowledge of Maven/Gradle

- Familiarity with dependency management tools like **Maven** or **Gradle**, as they are essential for handling dependencies in Spring Boot.

## 8. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Concepts

- Knowing how to interact with databases from Java using JDBC is helpful since you will work with databases a lot in Spring Boot.
- Basic SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).

## 9. Web Services and HTTP

- Familiarity with basic HTTP concepts, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods.
- Understanding how RESTful APIs work and handling JSON.
